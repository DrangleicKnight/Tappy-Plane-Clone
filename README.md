Tappy Plane is a clone of the well-known game Flappy Bird.
The purpose of this project was for me to get familiar with Godot and how the Game Engine works in comparison to Unity

The game has basic features such as:

#Scoring System:
  The score increases as you go through the lasers
#Parallax:
  A parallax background which gives a more immersive feel
#Collision
  Colliding with pipes gives you a Game Over Screen
